## HERO (generic)
Write a premium hero for a landing page. Brand: NeuraForge ("Purple Effect").
Include:
- Headline (benefit-first, 7–10 words)
- Subheadline (what we build, 20–30 words)
- 2 CTAs ("Start a Project", "View Work")
- A 3-item micro-trust row (short bullets)

## SERVICE PAGE (generic)
Create a service page for {{SERVICE_NAME}} by NeuraForge. Audience: SMB founders/ops.
Sections: 
1) Hero (benefit headline + specific outcomes)
2) Outcomes (5 bullets with plausible metrics)
3) Process (4 steps, 1 line each)
4) Deliverables (list of what you ship)
5) Stack (tool badges)
6) 2 mini "micro-case" blurbs
7) FAQ (4 Q&As)
8) CTA banner with urgency ("get a proposal in 48h")
Tone: confident, premium, crisp. No fluff.

## CASE STUDY (demo)
Write a demo case study with these sections:
- Snapshot: Industry, Timeline, Stack, Role
- Problem (real constraint)
- Approach (how we solved it)
- Result (3 metric callouts; mark as "demo data")
- 3–6 short captions for screenshots
- Closing CTA
Keep it honest and specific; 350–600 words; premium tone.

## PRICING TIERS
Write 3 pricing tiers for a boutique AI studio:
- Sprint (₹60k–₹1.2L / 1–2 weeks)
- Growth (₹1.2L–₹2.5L / 3–5 weeks)
- Dedicated (₹3L+ / month)
Each with: who it's for, outcomes, what's included, what's not, payment terms.

## PROCESS PAGE
Write a 5-step process (Discover → Scope & Success Metrics → Prototype → Build → Launch & Measure) with 2–3 sentences each, plus a timeline band and a CTA.

## ABOUT PAGE
Write "Why NeuraForge", credentials, how we work, light personal line, and social proof placeholders. 400–700 words.

## CTA LINES (generate 10)
Generate 10 clean CTA lines aligned with a premium studio (no hype).
