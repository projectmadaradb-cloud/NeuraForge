# E-commerce Scraper API (Demo)

## Snapshot
- Industry: E-commerce Analytics (demo)
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Stack: Python, FastAPI, Playwright, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL
- Role: Backend Development + DevOps + API Design

## Problem
Growth team needed competitor price monitoring across 50+ e-commerce sites with deduplication, price-change alerts, and structured data export. Manual monitoring was taking 20+ hours weekly and missing critical price drops that affected competitive positioning.

## Approach
Built rotating proxy pool with Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites. Implemented smart rate limiting, duplicate detection via content hashing, and real-time price-change webhooks. Containerized entire system with Redis caching for performance and horizontal scaling capability.

## Result *(demo data)*
- 94% scraping success rate across all target sites
- Zero IP blocks in 30 days of continuous operation
- 40% faster price update cycles vs manual monitoring
- 85% reduction in competitive analysis time

## Screens (captions)
1. Target site configuration dashboard with success rate monitoring
2. Real-time scraping status with proxy rotation visualization
3. Price history charts with automated alert trigger configuration
4. API documentation with structured output examples and rate limits
5. Export scheduler with multiple format options and webhook integrations
