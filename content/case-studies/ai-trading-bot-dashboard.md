# AI Trading Bot Dashboard (Demo)

## Snapshot
- Industry: FinTech (demo)
- Timeline: 3 weeks
- Stack: Next.js, FastAPI, WebSockets, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Role: Product Strategy + Full-stack Development + Infrastructure

## Problem
Portfolio managers needed real-time P&L monitoring with risk guardrails and fast strategy toggles across multiple exchanges without risking manual errors. Existing tools had 5-10 second delays and no integrated risk controls, making quick decisions impossible during volatile markets.

## Approach
Built real-time data pipeline streaming exchange feeds over WebSockets into a rules engine. Created guardrail layer with max exposure limits, stop-loss automation, and halt conditions. Designed UI with one-click strategy toggles, real-time alerts, and audit trails. Added feature flags for safe deployment of new strategies.

## Result *(demo data)*
- 45% reduction in manual trade errors
- <250ms UI update latency under high load
- 99.9% uptime for real-time data stream
- 30% faster decision-making during volatility
